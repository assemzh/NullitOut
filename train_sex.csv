Therefore, ""in an analogous sense, [gay marriage] is a 'social sin.'""

As long as Cathollic and other Christians consider that moral truths are found in the writings from people centuries ago, rather than in our own actual, personal experience, the Church will consider heterosexual sex activity the ""norm"" and gay activity to be ""abnormal"" . One as ""ordered"" to procreation; the other as ""disordered"".

These attitudes have been reinforced over the centuries. As long as they are considered Biblically mandated, they will be considered unchangeable; the law of God Himself.

As long as the Bible is considered to be the word of God Himself, Christians will think they cannot and should not change it.

If Christians could consider that God continues to reveal His Truth even in us, today, and that it might be possible that our own writing is also ""scripture"" inspired by God to teach us a greater understanding of the fullness of Truth – then we might be open to the possibility that God speaks to us through the LGBT community.",toxic,heterosexual

This led to young boys growing up with no experience of sex whatsoever and turning into adults who were actually terrified of adult/adult sex.

ODOM AND GOMORRAH COMES TO AMERICA
On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Constitution provides same-gender couples the right to marry, a historic triumph to the American gay rights movement. However, the decision is surely a tragedy and detriment to humankind for all time to come, placing us at the Hand of Almighty God’s Wrath.
El-Sheikh Gillani, addressed the decision as making it “the darkest day in human history.” He declared that this day was a black day in the history of mankind and that it was the day that humanity sunk to a level of debasement and shame. He resolved that every nation and religion on earth should remember this day and memorialize it every year as “Black Day.”

Only then will we be saved.” This is a CALL FOR ACTION...not only against gays, but against anyone who does not stand AGAINST them. It's the only way to save yourself. Pretty strong stuff.

The Certificate would be issued after a comprehensive examination by competent psychiatric and psychological experts. Every cleric who has faculties must be required to obtain the certificate, even married deacons and priests. (We know how sneaky the gays can be.)

Mr. DeBernardo's final paragraph hits the nail on the head and underscores the distinct lack of pastoral concern for gay people the world over. This is not the way the Church of Jesus Christ is supposed to behave toward ""the least of these."" Pope Francis, of all people, should know better.",non-toxic,homosexual_gay_or_lesbian

""My reaction to this article is that it is an essay in search of meaning. All ""analysis"" aside, the fact is that the hierarchal Church bans homosexuals from the priesthood. Period. Just as it bans the ordination of women. Period."" 

While agreeing with the gist of the rest of your comment, I am taken aback by by your opening lines. Surely, you don't really mean that the Church's ban on homosexuals is as firm as its ban on women as priests? 

At the level of practice, surely the exact opposite is true. There are no women currently active as priests or being accepted into seminaries, but the number of gay priests is estimated as high as 50%  of the present clergy, and probably is continuing to increase. Even if the reality is lower (say around 35%?) still the proportion of gay priests is way higher that the proportion of gay men in the population.

The ordination of women  was considered,  a number of heterodox sects ordained them based on deficient theologies of the Eucharist, and with no exceptions the Church treated these “orders” as null and void from the age of the Apostles to today. The ordinary magisterium, then, infallibly concluded that Jesus’ decision was part of the constitution of the sacrament.

Similarly while fornication was not mentioned in the Gospels, it was forbidden in the Old Testament, and was consistently treated as sinful by the Church with zero exceptions from the age of the Apostles to today.

The painful part of this is that once again the institutional church reveals such as limited knowledge of what it is to be a sexual being.

No one would equate being heterosexual with being in a constant state of sexual excitement.

It took some growing and maturing to figure out where the sexual part of me should be and how I would express it BUT as a nurse, I wasn't sexual with patients.  I learned to interact with patients that had different events related to sexuality and I learned from them.  My learning is ongoing.

Usually the Rabbis do not explain the meaning of Torah words. And the meaning of abomination seems reasonably clear - it is abhorrent to God.

The commentaries on the Talmud say that by abandoning heterosexual sexual relations, the person is straying from one of his prime goals in life - to procreate and populate the earth. Although the rabbis did not use the term ""natural law"", this is precisely what they are describing.

For young Christian gay adults, the options appear to be stark, live a single celibate life. As Christians we consider this to be a gift from God. Obviously Homosexuals have the same needs as heterosexuals for a loving sexual relationship, to impose celibacy upon any one, either a heterosexual or a homosexual person would create an intolerable situation within their heart, which would only serve to increase the desire for companionship and sexual intimacy...

It is certainly better than the pattern established under the previous two pontificates which saw witch hunts against gay people and a hardening of the church's position on LGTB issues. As an old person I'm comfortable with my church-going habits, but young people are not so ingrained in their habits. What they see, and what is true, is a church which teaches that gay people are somehow spiritually deformed and are therefore barred from various sacraments. To young people this is not acceptable.

Change will eventually come, but only after an entire generation of homophobes die out.

Given the high cost of hosting a Vatican council not to mention the valid concerns over terrorism, I suspect doctrine on LGTB issues will remain, stagnate, and eventually go stale the same way church teaching on contraception has gone stale. People will pay less and less attention to that teaching, further eroding the bishops' authority and further marginalizing their influence. As Martha Stewart would say, ""that's a good thing.""

In that former world, the fact we have free will, meant that anyone who violated those norms, be it extramarital sex or homosexuality, was freely choosing to violate nature. Now, in our current world, when we ask what is “natural” in terms of sexuality, we get very different answers. We are profoundly aware of psychological compulsion, so we are able to distinguish biological sex from sexual orientation, etc., etc.

So our dedication to natural law as a moral guide can be retained re sexual morality, but we understand our sexual nature differently, so we must be open to re-conceive the guidance of the Spirit. Sure, the episcopal magisterium is stuck in the old worldview, but theologians and most educated laity have move forward. Since the Church is all of us, we can and should say that the Church has grown organically primarily in our generation and that of our children and grandchildren.

Also, you state: 'If there is no God, humans have invented the concepts of good and evil…there is no absolute moral standard, and what one generation or society or culture decides is evil may be considered perfectly acceptable by another' - but that is exactly how it goes: slavery was condoned in in the old testament, while homosexuality was condemned, yet today the views on these are 180 degrees in the opposite direction.

If one endorses this paradigm and is consistent, then ANY act causing sexual gratification that does not involve the penis inside the vagina would be considered sinful.

I think it is very challenging to begin a true discussion when theologians (97 theologians according to Matthew Fox) have lost their ability to teach in Catholic institutions (where else would a Catholic theologian teach), when the starting framework is that homosexual acts are ""intrinsically disordered,"" and the inclination is a ""strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil"" (Ratzinger, 10/1/86).

IMHO, what we need is a new philosophy based on the great work over the last century in knowledge, science and psychology. Without a new framework (e.g., Ken Wilber), I don't see how any conversation can begin.

Or do you think that the very fact that one of his cakes was being used for a gay wedding is what he objected to?

Which is a fatal flaw in the teaching of the catechism. All sex acts are not ordered to the procreation of human life; they can't be.  All married couples are infertile at some point.  Either they start that way or they become that way in the aging process. In addition, the female spouse is naturally infertile much of the time.  None of those sex acts during infertility are ordered to procreation.  The approved NFP method attempts to have sex at an infertile time.

  The value in this observation is that once a group falls into this behaviour pattern, all members participate and reinforce the pattern and accept it as necessary or inevitable, even if they don't like it.

I tend to think in terms of the nature of the criminal violations, rather than the speculative matter of the perpetrator's orientation. The Spacey story reminded me of my own rape.

0.6% of gays and 5.7% of lesbians committed suicide (rates dozens of times those of non-gays); and
0.6% of gays and 4.3% of lesbians died in motor vehicle accidents (over 17 times the rate of non-gays)
These events, coupled with various STDs (especially AIDS) gotten from other gays, resulted in a median age of death of 40 among gays and a median age of death of 45 among lesbians.

Fey's been used to disparage gay men since forever.  Go look up the definition of f*ggot and d*ke too then get back to me with how those words are okay cuz they mean bundles of sticks and dam.  I have never ever heard the word fey used in the same sentence as a gay man where it wasn't shorthand for f*g.  But why let facts get in the way of all you angry peeps who think everything is about you being corrected as opposed to kindness, compassion, and being good at your job.",non-toxic,homosexual_gay_or_lesbian
6326644,"There was the article last weekend about Sam Adams' staffer who accused him of lewd discussions and eyeing advances. Sam Adams denied the claims and welcomed an investigation. In this story we have Roy Moore who is accused by multiple women of being approached for sex while they were under the age of consent. He too denies the claims. In both cases we can either assume they are guilty or that they're being falsely accused.

If the accused are innocent, then the accusers are wrong. If they are guilty, they are indefensible. One would have committed a serious crime. Morally we all agree on these points.

People assumed Sam Adams was guilty. Guilty BECAUSE he was gay. It was discussed as no surprise. Reasoning that gay people are like this as well as a number of other horrible things (serial killers, etc). People who made comments like that are the same ones here today figuring Roy Moore is guilty, defending him, and then shaming his victims.

A horrific double standard.",toxic,homosexual_gay_or_lesbian

I wondered this because, in addition to all his other characteristics, he had a gay affect.

6329999,"One of the most abhorrent things coming from this guys “Christian” supporters is that the Bible supports sexual abuse of underage children by way of the example of the Virgin Mary and Joseph and therefore the word of God supports Moore.  This is a breaking of the 10 Commandments— according to Paul, the most important being the use of God’s name in vane which constitutes a profound disrespect of God. According to Paul, God’s punishment for those using God’s name in vane to minister for their own causes is to turn them into lusting persons including homosexuals that will face further punishment beyond that.",toxic,homosexual_gay_or_lesbian
6330414,"That is why I named them and didn't just call them Christians.  In fact, my maternal grandfather was an Anglican priest and my mother the kind of Christian where she derived guidance, solace and comfort from her religion.  My father however was vile about homosexuals and used his religion to judge and deride and feel righteous. God was a man and men were made in God's image and therefore men rule the households and the world.  All religions have these extremes.  I do feel religion has an important place for charity and to teach tolerance, love, inclusion and to lift up those who have less or are in need. It sounds like this is you and I fully respect that type of Christianity.  But religion isn't the only avenue to teach and learn ethics and morality and, unfortunately, the good aspects of religion are too often overwhelmed by the bad and abuse of religion to say G-d is on their side.

In my workplace over the years (35) I had eight gay men and ten lesbians as colleagues (they all belonged to Catholic families). Our daughter's first boyfriend was the adopted son of a lesbian couple. In my husband's family, (huge Irish Catholic group) there are quite a few gays and lesbians and nobody gets their knickers in a twist. In my parish, there are a number of gay couples, including one couple who has adopted four special needs kids. I don't go by statistics, since they often lie...I go by lived experience - many gays and lesbians to this day keep their reality private for fear of losing a job or being socially rejected...so yes, most families...and the really sad thing is when the family rejects their gay son or daughter.",toxic,homosexual_gay_or_lesbian
