239669,I think you left out one very important organization who help the mentally ill over 18. NAMI Multnomah. They help people with mental distress find within or without NAMI to find them the services that can be most beneficial to them.  I am a volunteer for NAMI Multnomah in their Connection program. It is a walk-in group to people 18 and up. No matter the diagnosis we welcome them and help them learn new coping skills and develop tools to further  help them learn to cope from week to week. We have groups all over Multnomah County. By going  to http://nami.multnomah.org/. You will with out much difficulty find the list of Connection Groups and their times and locations.,non-toxic,psychiatric_or_mental_illness

The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness.

By history there have always been folk in need who had no sustainable income for various reasons -  roaming ""hobo's"" , addiction, mental illness, etc. So here's the point, in the early days most of these same individuals would seek out odd  "" jobs"" for pay. The ""hobo"" community had a network of  private homes and businesses who hired by the job, day or project. An exchange of work for pay; honor, integrity and a general respect and appreciation for all involved. Fast forward to today. No longer seeking to trade work for cash...we now have panhandling - simply make a sign, stand on a corner and EXPECT people to give you money. It's really not about the unhoused or the addict needing treatment, those needs are already being worked on in almost every community, give money to those causes if inclined.

2. People unable to take care of themselves because of substance abuse. Other countries do way better than we do. Give them treatment. Demand that they get it. Treatment, work, or community service. 
3. People who choose homeless as a lifestyle, a choice they make. Put them to work. Community service. Pay them fairly. Fund it by decriminalizing substance abuse, saving money on jails.

First, I agree that many charitable organizations do a great deal to help the homeless and destitute.  The Eugene Mission and St. Vinnies immediately come to mind.  However, they only serve a small portion of the homeless population.  The Mission is not equipped to work with the mentally ill and is will not accept individuals who are ""under the influence"" or drugs or alcohol.  I understand the reasoning for the policy and have no quarrel with it.  

However, it's important to remember that chronic alcoholism and substance abuse are both diseases which require extensive rehabilitative support if they're to be treated.  The homeless and impoverished do not have these services available to them.  It's easy for some to say ""hey, you Bum, quit your damn drinking!""  Easy to say.........hard to do..

It matters not what manner of affliction causes the suffering, it's the fact that the suffering is intolerable and untreatable that informs the right to an assisted death.

When Columbine happened I hoped that educational practices would be changed instead of a focus on gun control.
